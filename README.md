## Introduction

**Student 2021 version**

The university does not provide a tool to export all your grades. And, you need to manually copy courses from webpage to your MS Excel(R) book. Therefore, I provide a tool to complete this task.

**Notes:** The university will update new scores to data center HALF A YEAR later than to the course system.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have connected to the computer network in Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting and Finance. **If you connect with proxies, this program does not work because it doesn't trust your system proxies.**
2. Open `main_public.py`, and fill student IDs you want to inquire in the `username` Python list.
3. Run `main_public.py`.
4. Get your transcripts in the `grades` folder.
